# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hi, I'm Fatima Almemari, a high school student graduating in 2025. I have a deep passion for engineering, AI, arts, natural sciences, astronomy, photography and history. I'm also new to programming, and currently working on exploring different coding languages and tech projects. Beyond academics, I actively volunteer as a youth ranger, where I cultivate my love for nature and the environment.<br>
